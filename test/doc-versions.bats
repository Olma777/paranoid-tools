# One source of versions. The audit of 2026-09-07 (F08) found user-facing install docs pinned to
# versions two releases behind the code — a reader who follows them installs something other than
# what the page describes. release.yml already keeps install.sh, the umbrella version map and
# verify-releases.sh in lockstep with the tag; prose was the part nobody checked.
#
# Only install instructions are checked — a release-download URL and a `<TOOL>_VERSION=` pin.
# Historical mentions ("since v0.3.0", changelogs) are none of this test's business.
