# Paranoid Tools — GUI (Phase B)

Native **menu-bar (macOS)** and **system-tray (Windows)** agents over the same signed CLIs.
This is the optional *convenience* layer — Phase A is the cross-platform `paranoid` TUI launcher
(repo root). Phase B adds a one-glance status indicator + quick actions without opening a terminal.

## Honesty (same contract as Phase A)

The GUI **holds no secrets and adds no crypto**. It only:
- shows read-only status (vault open/closed, FileVault/BitLocker) in the menu bar / tray, and
- launches the **same CLIs you installed** (`securetrash`, `panic`, `paranoid`) — resolved
  through `PATH` at runtime, not re-verified per launch (signatures are checked at install
  time; see the launcher note in the root README) — and every destructive op
  and every password prompt happens **in the CLI** (a terminal/console window opens with the
  tool's real output); secrets never pass through the GUI.

So the GUI cannot weaken the tools' guarantees: it is a launcher, not a new tool.

## What's here (this commit)

| Platform | File | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| macOS | `macos/ParanoidBar.swift` + `macos/build.sh` | **Signed + notarized** (Developer ID, hardened runtime, ticket stapled); source compiles with `swiftc` (Command Line Tools). AppKit `NSStatusItem` menu-bar agent: monochrome SF-Symbol status glyph (adapts to light/dark menu bar), live vault/FileVault status, **vaultwatch session + TTL countdown** (in the glyph + menu), Status/PANIC/Vault▸(open·close·empty·destroy)/launcher, **Start at login** toggle (LaunchAgent), runs CLIs via Terminal. |
| Windows | `windows/paranoid-tray.ps1` (+ Pester) | **Runnable PowerShell** (no compile). `NotifyIcon` tray, same menu + **vaultwatch TTL countdown** (tooltip + menu headers) + **Start at login** toggle (HKCU Run), runs CLIs in a new console. Menu/status/autostart/vaultwatch logic Pester-tested. |

**Phase B polish (product-grade UX, both platforms, full feature parity):**

- **Global panic hotkey** — ⌃⌥⇧P on macOS (Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey`, no Accessibility
  permission needed), Ctrl+Alt+Shift+P on Windows (`RegisterHotKey` + a hidden message window).
  Double-press within 2s → `panic now --hard` fires (a terminal/console opens with real output —
  the honesty contract holds; the double-press itself is the confirmation, no extra dialog).
  Single press arms + notifies. Presets (P / L / Off) in Settings; a failed registration is
  reported honestly, never silently swallowed.
  "PANIC NOW" means the same thing everywhere: the GUI menu item, the hotkey, and the launcher's
  menu entry all run `panic now --hard` (hide & lock + kill cloud daemons + clear recents).
- **Native notifications** — TTL warning (<120s to auto-close), TTL expired while still open,
  and a long-open reminder (30+ min without a vaultwatch session). Pure decision engine, fires
  once per episode, re-arms if the session is extended. Delivery via `osascript` on macOS,
  `NotifyIcon.ShowBalloonTip` on Windows.
- **Welcome onboarding (first run)** — a live readiness checklist (CLI installed / vault created
  / hotkey enabled / start at login) with action buttons, shown once on first launch and always
  reachable from the menu ("Setup guide…") and from Settings.
- **RU/EN localization** — an in-code string dictionary (49 keys), no `.lproj` bundles (keeps the
  single-file design). Language: System / English / Русский in Settings. Key parity between the
  two languages and between macOS and Windows is enforced by test.
- **Settings v2** — vault volume, poll interval, language, panic-hotkey preset, and a "Setup
  guide" button, all in the existing settings window.
- **Windows: privileged actions go through UAC, like the terminal launcher.** The vault is
  diskpart + BitLocker and `panic` has to close BitLocker volumes — none of that works without
  administrator rights, and a tray started normally (or from HKCU Run) has none. So the tray
  raises a single UAC prompt for `securetrash vault …` and `panic now`, the menu item says in
  advance that it will ask, and a declined prompt is reported as "nothing was done" instead of
  opening a console that quietly fails half its work.

Verified here: macOS source compiles cleanly (`swiftc -O`) and passes `./ParanoidBar --selftest`
(pure-logic checks: hotkey preset parsing, notification decision engine, localization-dictionary
completeness, onboarding-checklist state — `gui/macos/test.sh` runs both as the build gate).
Windows tray menu/dispatch/autostart/hotkey/notification/localization/onboarding logic is
Pester-tested in CI (`gui/windows/test` runs on `windows-latest`). The two mirror each other and
the bash launcher's grouping.

## Download (macOS)

Signed, notarized, stapled — [`ParanoidBar-0.1.0.dmg`](https://github.com/Di-kairos/paranoid-tools/releases/download/gui-v0.1.0/ParanoidBar-0.1.0.dmg)
(`gui-v0.1.0`, sha256 `da80707bb0e63a9deb3a05a0387ef64b75db6b6d2c28c25a5170d293b445b00a`). Open it,
drag the app onto `/Applications`. It drives the five CLIs, so install those first — see the
[root README](../README.md#install). Building it yourself is below; the Windows tray has no
release yet and runs from this clone.

## Build / run

**macOS**
```bash
cd macos
./build.sh            # → ./ParanoidBar  (run it: a 🔒 appears in the menu bar)
./build.sh --bundle   # → ParanoidBar.app (LSUIElement: menu-bar agent, no Dock icon)

# release build — signed + notarized .dmg (needs an Apple Developer account; see below):
./build.sh --bundle --sign "Developer ID Application: NAME (TEAMID)" --notarize <profile> --dmg
./build.sh --bundle --sign -   # ad-hoc: exercises the codesign path locally (NOT distributable)
```
`--bundle` also puts `macos/ParanoidBar.icns` into the bundle's `Resources` and points
`CFBundleIconFile` at it, so Finder and the disk image show the project's mark — the terminal
square with the prompt chevron from `assets/logo.svg` — instead of the generic app icon. The
`.icns` carries every size from 16 to 1024 (@1x and @2x), each drawn from the vector rather than
downscaled, so the small ones stay sharp.
`--sign` runs `codesign` with hardened runtime + `--verify`; `--notarize <profile>` zips, submits
via `notarytool --wait`, then staples + validates. `--dmg` builds a compressed `hdiutil` image
holding the `.app` next to an `/Applications` symlink, then signs, notarizes and staples the
image **separately** — Gatekeeper checks the `.dmg` as its own artifact when you open it, and the
inner app's ticket does not cover that. The image also carries its window layout: a fixed 640×400
icon view, 128px icons, and an engraved background with an arrow pointing the app at the
`/Applications` symlink. Finder is the only thing that writes that layout (it lives in the volume's
`.DS_Store`), so the build mounts a writable image, drives Finder over Automation, and only then
compresses it to UDZO. Between mounting and laying out it waits for Finder to actually see the
volume: `hdiutil attach` returns before DiskArbitration has told Finder about it, and asking too
early fails with `-1728` — which looks exactly like a refused Automation prompt, except the image
comes out signed, notarized and unstyled. In a headless session — CI or ssh, where Automation is
refused for real — the step prints a warning and the image is still built, just without the layout. `--version X.Y.Z` stamps
both. Only the real Developer-ID
sign + notary submission need the account; without one, the ad-hoc path still exercises the
pipeline mechanics.

**Windows**
```powershell
pwsh -File windows/paranoid-tray.ps1   # a Shield icon appears in the tray; right-click for the menu
```

## Signing and distribution

**macOS is signed and notarized.** `ParanoidBar.app` is signed with a Developer ID Application
certificate under hardened runtime and a secure timestamp, notarized by Apple, and the notary
ticket is stapled into the bundle — so Gatekeeper accepts it offline too, on a machine that has
never seen this app:

```
spctl --assess --type execute ParanoidBar.app   → accepted, source=Notarized Developer ID
xcrun stapler validate ParanoidBar.app          → the validate action worked
codesign -dvv                                   → flags=0x10000(runtime), Developer ID Application
```

**The `.dmg` is signed and notarized too**, in its own right — verified by mounting the finished
image and checking what is actually inside it, not just the file on disk:

```
spctl --assess --type open --context context:primary-signature ParanoidBar-X.Y.Z.dmg
                                                → accepted, source=Notarized Developer ID
mounted: ParanoidBar.app + an /Applications symlink (drag-n-drop install)
the mounted app: accepted · stapler validate ok · codesign --test-requirement="=notarized" ok
```

Reproduce a release build yourself (the identity string comes from
`security find-identity -v -p codesigning`, the notary profile from
`xcrun notarytool store-credentials`):

```bash
cd macos
./build.sh --bundle --sign "Developer ID Application: NAME (TEAMID)" \
           --notarize <profile> --dmg --version X.Y.Z
```

Neither the app bundle nor the `.dmg` is committed — both are build artifacts (`.gitignore`),
rebuilt from source.

**Windows is not signed yet.** The tray ships as a `.ps1`, which needs an Authenticode
code-signing certificate from a commercial CA — a separate purchase from the Apple account, not
covered by it. Until that lands, run the Windows GUI from this repo; the CLIs it drives are
signed and verified at install time regardless.

## Not done yet (honest scope — the rest of Phase B)

- **Windows code signing** — an Authenticode certificate for the tray `.ps1` (see above), and a
  signed launch shim so the Windows GUI installs like anything else instead of running from a
  clone. The macOS half of this item — signing, notarization and a `.dmg` — is done.

UX polish is done: hotkey, notifications, onboarding, RU/EN, and the settings pane (vault-volume
override, poll interval, language, hotkey preset — see the table above) all shipped in Phase B.
What remains is the Windows certificate — not UX, and not macOS.

The GUI is free, like the CLIs, and stays that way: no paid tier, no feature held back for one.
If it is useful to you, the project takes donations — nothing else is being sold.
